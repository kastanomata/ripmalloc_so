HOW TO USE THE MEMORY PROFILER 
Files considered MUST be in the ./benchmarks folder and have the .alloc extension
Lines that start with % will be ignored
Commands:
i,<allocator type> where allocator type can be slab, buddy or bitmap
p,<param1>,<param2>,...
Note: put these commands one after the other
PARAMS
  for slab:
    param1 = slab_size
    param2 = num_slabs
  for buddy and bitmap
    param1 = memory_size
    param2 = max_levels

then for fixed size allocation:
a,<index> where index is the index in a array that keeps track of allocation. 
f,<index> 
then for fixed size allocation:
a,<index>,<size> where index is the index in a array that keeps track of allocation.
f,<index> 
Note: DO NOT allocate more than once on the same index without freeing! You will lose track of the pointer and be unable to find it!
